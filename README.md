# 2D-VQ-AE-2
2D Vector-Quantized Auto-Encoder for compression of Whole-Slide Images in Histopathology

# How to run
## Locally
```bash
python train.py train_datamodule.train_dataloader_conf.dataset.path=<camelyon_path> train_datamodule.val_dataloader_conf.dataset.path=<camelyon_path>
```
## Lisa
set `CAMELYON16_PATH`, and append `--multirun` to automatically submit a `sbatch` job through `submitit`, which copies CAMELYON16 to `$SCRATCH` of the allocated node.
```bash
CAMELYON16_PATH=<camelyon-path> python train.py --multirun
```

Change node type by overwriting the node config, e.g.:
```bash
python train.py <dataset-path-args> hydra/launcher/node@hydra.launcher=gpu_titanrtx --multirun
```
